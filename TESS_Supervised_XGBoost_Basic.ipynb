    "The model is tested against cross validation using stratified k fold which maintains the original ratio of 1to 0 in the training data when creating folds. The scores for roc_auc are then reported along with the mean and standard deviation. The model is then used to predict the last 20% of the data and the accuracy and roc_auc are reported.   \n",

As wepreviously discussed I think its a good idea to take the training positive examples (1) and subsample the negative examples to create balanced data sets which can then be used to train the data.   \n",

    "The accuracy metric is also one of the most important factors in training a good model and I think it is a good idea to research which metrics exist and how they compare to roc_auc as certain papers and competitions have used area under precision recall and kappa as scoring metrics for unbalanced datasets.
